The allocator follows the following rules:
1. If an allocation of size of 5, 10, or 20 is requested, the allocator should assign it to one of the
appropriately sized quick fit blocks.
2. For any other allocation size, it should assign it a free region in the catchall area, using the first-fit
algorithm.
3. If a block of size 5, 10, or 20 is requested, but all of the appropriate-sized blocks are full, then it should
use the catchall area for the request.
4. If the catchall area doesnâ€™t have an open slot big enough to accommodate a request, then your
program should use the smallest one of the 5, 10, and 20 blocks that fits the request and is not in use
5. If there is no way at all to accommodate a request, then your program should print that there is no
room.
6. Anytime free is called, the allocator should free up the memory being held by the allocation specified.
